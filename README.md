# tun-xray

Very simple set of scripts to use xray socks5 proxy as tun adapter and redirect all requests to specific ip list via socks5 proxy on router level.

I'm using it on Ubiquiti router, but i think it should work on any linux based platform with systemd.

Used projects:

[Xray](https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-core)
[tun2socks](https://github.com/xjasonlyu/tun2socks)
